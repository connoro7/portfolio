              <p> Over very large length scales on the order of 300 million light years or so, the matter and energy that make up the universe take on a nearly-homogeneous isotopic distribution. As the observational scale decreases, a hierarchy of matter and energy distribution emerges first within galactic filaments, then superclusters, clusters, and so on moving down to atoms and elementary particles. On the largest of scales, the geometry of the local (observable) universe and beyond (global universe) remains yet unsolved. Observational evidence supports that global spacetime has zero curvature, is unbounded, and is infinite with a 0.4% margin of error. The experimental error with current data is large enough however that the sign on the curvature cannot be constrained, which only permits spacetime to be approximated as Euclidean.</p>

          <a href="/docs/BlackholeThermodynamics.pdf" target="_blank"><h3><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i>Black Hole Thermodynamics </h3></a>
            <p>Despite the seemingly impossible task of looking at a black hole experimentally, the thermo-dynamics of black holes is still a active field of theoretical study. In an effort to reconcile our current understanding of the nature of black holes with the laws of thermodynamics, we encounter black hole entropy as a consequence of the preservation of said laws. By postulating that a black hole must have entropy, we are able to develop four laws that describe the specific nature of the thermodynamics of black holes. Furthermore, we can examine black holes over both finite and infinite amounts of time in such a way that we can investigate how black holes behave as potential heat engines.</p>

          <a href="/docs/ProbingForDarkMatterGravitationalWaves.pdf" target="_blank"><h3><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i>Probing for Dark Matter Using Gravitational Wave Interferometry</h3></a>
            <p>With the recent detection of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), new limits have been set on the merging densities and rates of a predicted source of dark matter known as primordial black holes. Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a theoretical class of black hole that would have formed under the extreme conditions and high matter densities of the early universe rather than the core-collapse of a high-mass star or other processes associated with later evolutionary periods of the universe. PBHs have been hypothesized to partially or completely explain dark matter clusters and are also thought to be potential sources of gravitational waves. Here, I explore the possibility that PBH dark matter has been detected by aLIGO, and how future searches for gravitational waves (GW) by aLIGO and related classes of GW interferometers can be used to probe the large-scale distribution of PBH dark matter clusters within the universe.</p>
